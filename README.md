# Quick Block for the Arduboy
The aim of the game is to tag all the blocks before the timer runs out, compete with friends or family to see who is the fastest

## What's New?

* An option to vary the the score goal and time to make it easier or harder, the cursor is much more adaptive on the menu
* The character had some separation issues from the top wall, but I was able to help him out
* Parts are more aligned and even (e.g The ending screen determines if your time is above 10 secs and then evens the positioning on the screen)
* The game was being mean and was stuck saying “You Lose!”, which isn’t very nice so I fixed it’s attitude
* Border is more constricted so you can’t hide on the edge like a snake in grass
* Fixed some small issues with the timer
