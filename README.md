# Quick Block for the Arduboy
The aim of the game is to tag all the blocks before the timer runs out, compete with friends or family to see who is the fastest

* Thanks for the help a certain someone
* Interrupts are now removed and replaced by a better system
* Clean ups here and there

* Support for the emulator using `millis()` and interrupts makes it able for anyone to play now
* Cleaned up some bits here and there

### 11/8/2020
* An option to vary the the score goal and time to make it easier or harder, the cursor is much more adaptive on the menu
* The character had some separation issues from the top wall, but I was able to help him out
* Parts are more aligned and even (e.g The ending screen determines if your time is above 10 secs and then evens the positioning on the screen)
* The game was being mean and was stuck saying "You Lose!", which isn't very nice so I fixed it's attitude
* Border is more constricted so you can't hide on the edge like a snake in grass
* Fixed some small issues with the timer
